Scripts I threw together for quickly gathering forensic artifacts from suspect memory/disk image(s), carving, etc.

1. cd into lists/nsrl/ and run pull.sh to download the latest rds_modernm list - unzip it and then run build_nsrl_idx.sh to build the index.  
2. edit settings.conf and make sure all variables have been filled in.
3. run scripts individually, or batch.sh to run them all.

Suite is still under development, but coming along quickly!
